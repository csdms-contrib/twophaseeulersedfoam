HOW TO COMPILE AND USE THE NEW SOLVER---twoPhaseEulerSedFoam
*************************************************************

(1) This solver is modified based on the twoPhaseEulerFoam solver in OpenFOAM-2.1.0, and it is only tested and validated in OpenFOAM-2.1.0, so the performance under other OpenFOAM versions is not guaranteed. It is suggested that OpenFOAM-2.1.0 is installed successfully before this solver is compiled. 

(2) In this uncompressed folder, the following files can be found:

/Example    /twoPhaseEulerSedFoam
License     README User_Manual.pdf

(3) The source code for the new solver twoPhaseEulerSedFoam is under the folder of twoPhaseEulerSedFoam. In order to compile the new solver, copy the folder twoPhaseEulerSedFoam to the directory: $FOAM_APP/solver/multiphase/

(4) Go to the directory: $FOAM_APP/solver/multiphase/twoPhaseEulerSedFoam, then type the following:

./Allwmake

Then the code will start to compile, and the command generated for this solver is twoPhaseEulerSedFoam 

(5) Example files are included under the folder of /Example in the uncompressed files.

(6) The model formulations and a summary of the major modifications are discussed in detail in the User_Manual.pdf
